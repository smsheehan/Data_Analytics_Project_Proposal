The US government's Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funds the continuum of care (COC) in major cities and select rural areas across the USA.

As a requirement for receiving funding, every COC must conduct a Point In Time (PIT) count.  One night every year a group of service providers and volunteers in each city surveys and counts the homeless individuals and families.  Additionally, COCs must provide a Housing Inventory Count (HIC) and maintain a Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) database.  While the HMIS database is not open to the public, HUD makes available the PIT and HIC data from across the country.  https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/ahar/2020-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness-in-the-us.html

Nationwide, there is a disturbing trend in the percentage of unsheltered homeless.

We also see this trend in Indianapolis, especially in 2021.  Here in Indianapolis, the agency known as CHIP (Coalition for Homelessness Intervention and Prevention) is the coordinating entity to ensure our city meets HUD reporting requirements.  Some information on the 2021 PIT cound here in Indy can be found at:  https://www.chipindy.org/reports.html

This proposal suggests that we use the HUD nationwide PIT and HIC datasets for major cities in the contiguous United States combined with other relevant city demographic (and potentially other city data such as budgetary allocations) to evaluate if machine learning models can identify factors (investment in low barrier shelter beds, investment in housing first units, federal funding levels, etc) which lead to better outcomes (lower homelessness as a percentage of city population).

I am not aware of anyone to date using machine learning models on homelessness datasets.  The hypothesis for this project is that we will be able to find correlations between certain factors across these broad nation-wide data sets with outcomes.  These findings would then be the first step in helping to guide additional dialog and potentially new investments in our city.  The Mayor's office will be very interested to review any findings we have.  * Let's use our newly acquired skills to make a difference in the lives of our homeless neighbors!
